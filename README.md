## 🔒 API Security

Securing the backend APIs is critical to protecting both user data and platform integrity. Below are the key security measures implemented:

### Key Measures
- **Authentication**: Only verified users can access protected endpoints using token-based authentication (e.g., JWT).
- **Authorization**: Role-based access controls ensure that only users with the right permissions (e.g., host, admin) can perform specific actions.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and brute-force attacks by limiting the number of requests from a single IP or user in a given time frame.
- **Input Validation & Sanitization**: Prevents injection attacks (e.g., SQL, XSS).
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Ensures all data exchanged between client and server is encrypted.
- **Secure Payment Handling**: Payment endpoints are isolated and integrated with trusted providers, with sensitive transaction data never stored in plain text.

### Why It Matters
- **User Data Protection**: Prevents unauthorized access to personal and sensitive user information.
- **Transaction Security**: Secures financial data during booking and payment operations.
- **System Integrity**: Protects backend systems from malicious activity and downtime.
- **Trust and Compliance**: Maintains platform credibility and helps meet data protection regulations.

## 🔁 CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) streamline the development lifecycle by automating testing, building, and deploying code.

### Why CI/CD is Important
- **Faster Development**: Automates code integration and testing.
- **Reduced Errors**: Catches bugs early in the development process.
- **Consistent Deployments**: Ensures the same environment is used every time.
- **Improved Collaboration**: Enables team members to work on features independently without integration conflicts.

### Tools Used
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates testing and deployment workflows.
- **Docker**: Provides consistent environments for development, testing, and production.
- **Docker Compose**: Manages multi-container environments easily.
- **CI/CD Scripts**: Custom bash or YAML scripts to run builds, migrations, and tests.

---

## 🧪 Manual Review

The project is regularly subjected to **manual code and feature reviews** to ensure:

- **Security Compliance**: All endpoints and sensitive operations are double-checked.
- **Functional Integrity**: Features are manually tested against requirements.
- **Code Quality**: Developers verify that the code follows project standards.
- **Documentation Accuracy**: README and API documentation reflect the current state of the codebase.

Manual reviews are essential in addition to automated testing to catch issues related to user experience, unclear documentation, or edge cases that tools might miss.
